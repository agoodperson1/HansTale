Bugs that need to be fixed:

if monster pushes player against a wall, monster can no longer damage player because he is 
already inside the player's collision box and can not move

player should not move when there is skill card

player can not immediately roll after attacking

More Health
Faster Stamina Regen
Double Arrow
Triple Shot
life steal

sword damage
